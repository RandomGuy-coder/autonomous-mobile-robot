This project was developed in ROS Noetic, therefore hasn't been tested for other ROS versions.

This project requires OpenCV 4.2 to be built from source with NON-FREE modules.

Find-Object2d and Vision_opencv should be built from source once opencv is installed.

To run the project:

Step 1:
roslaunch mapping gazebo_robot_world.launch world:= <pass the world to run>

Step 2:
Add the coke can in the scene, can be found in gazebo models.

Step 3:
roslaunch mapping rtab_and_exploration.launch

Step 4:
roslaunch recog_findobject.launch 
The findobject might need configuration as it wasn't tested on a fresh ubuntu installtion
